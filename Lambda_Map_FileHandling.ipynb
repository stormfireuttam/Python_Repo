        "## What is First Class Function?\n",
        "\n",
        "In programming, a \"first-class function\" is a term used to describe a programming language construct in which functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be treated just like any other data type, such as integers or strings. Specifically, first-class functions have the following properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "* They can be assigned to a variable or stored in a data structure.\n",
        "* They can be passed as an argument to a function.\n",
        "* They can be returned as a result from a function.\n",
        "* They can be stored in data structures such as lists and dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in Python, a function can be assigned to a variable:\n",
        "```\n",
        "def my_function():\n",
        "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "greet = my_function\n",
        "greet()\n",
        "```\n",
        "It can also be passed as an argument to another function:\n",
        "```\n",
        "def call_function(func):\n",
        "    func()\n",
        "\n",
        "call_function(my_function)\n",
        "```\n",
        "and returned as a result from a function:\n",
        "```\n",
        "def return_function():\n",
        "    return my_function\n",
        "\n",
        "greet = return_function()\n",
        "greet()\n",
        "```\n",
        "Languages like Python, Lisp, Smalltalk, Lua and Ruby have first-class functions as a built-in feature, while other languages like C and C++ can emulate first-class functions through function pointers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, in a language with \"first-class functions\", functions are not considered to be first-class citizens and cannot be treated in the same way as data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is High Order Function?\n",
        "\n",
        "A \"higher-order function\" is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, and/or returns a function as its result. It operates on functions by either applying them as arguments, or by returning them. These types of functions are called \"higher-order\" because they work on other functions, in contrast to \"first-order\" functions which only operate on values.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a common higher-order function in Python is map(), which takes a function and an iterable as arguments, and applies the function to each element of the iterable. Here's an example of using map() to square a list of numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n",
        "```\n",
        "Another example of a higher-order function is filter(), which takes a function and an iterable as arguments, and returns an iterable containing only the elements for which the function returned True. Here's an example of using filter() to get only the even numbers from a list:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
        "even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
        "```\n",
        "Higher-order functions can also return other functions. An example of a higher-order function that returns a function is a closure, which is a function that \"closes over\" or captures a variable from its containing scope:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "def make_adder(n):\n",
        "    def adder(x):\n",
        "        return x + n\n",
        "    return adder\n",
        "\n",
        "add_five = make_adder(5)\n",
        "print(add_five(3)) # 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "Higher-order functions are a powerful feature of functional programming and can make code more expressive, composable and reusable.\n"

        "### Q1) File Handling Modes in Python\n",
        "In Python, file handling can be performed using built-in open() function. The open() function takes two arguments, the first one is the name of the file, and the second one is the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode in which a file should be opened depends on the type of operation that needs to be performed on the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following are the different modes in which a file can be opened in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **'r' (Read Only)**: This mode opens the file in read-only mode. It is the default mode in which a file is opened. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **'w' (Write Only):** This mode opens the file in write-only mode. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. If the file already exists, all its contents are truncated (deleted).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **'a' (Append Only):** This mode opens the file in append-only mode. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. If the file already exists, new data is appended to the end of the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **'r+' (Read and Write):** This mode opens the file in read and write mode. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **'w+' (Write and Read):** This mode opens the file in write and read mode. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. If the file already exists, all its contents are truncated (deleted).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **'a+' (Append and Read):** This mode opens the file in append and read mode. If the file does not exist, a new file is created. If the file already exists, new data is appended to the end of the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to close a file after performing operations on it, this can be done using the close() method on the file object. Additionally, you can use the with statement in python, this automatically handle the closing of the file for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**\"x\" mode** In file handling, the \"x\" mode is used to open a file for exclusive creation. This means that the file will only be created if it does not already exist. If the file already exists, the operation will fail and an error will be raised. This mode is typically used when the programmer wants to ensure that a new file is created, and that no other process can access the file until it is closed.\n",

        "\n",
        "The readlines() function, on the other hand, reads all the lines of a file and returns them as a list of strings. Each line, including the newline character, is an element of the list. If the file is empty, it will return an empty list.\n",
        "\n",
